= Introduction
Targeted advertisement refers to the practice of using personal 
data—such as online behavior, demographics, location, and interests—to 
deliver customized marketing content to individual users. 
This technique has become central to the business models of major 
digital platforms, enabling highly efficient advertising that funds 
many free online services. As data collection technologies and 
algorithmic profiling grow more sophisticated, targeted advertising 
increasingly shapes how people encounter information online. While 
the practice offers economic benefits and improved ad relevance, it 
also introduces ethical questions concerning privacy, autonomy, and 
the influence digital platforms exert over user behavior and societal 
discourse.

= Problem Formulation
Targeted advertisement relies on the large-scale
collection and analysis of personal data to deliver
individualized marketing messages. While this practice
increases advertising efficiency and supports free digital
services, it also raises significant ethical concerns.
Users often lack meaningful control over how their data 
is collected, combined, and used, creating risks of privacy
invasion, manipulation, and discrimination. At the same time, 
advertisers and online platforms have strong economic incentives
to expand targeting capabilities. The central problem is how to 
balance commercial interests and technological innovation with 
users’ rights to autonomy, privacy, and fair treatment. 
Key stakeholders include consumers, technology platforms, 
advertisers, data brokers, and regulators.
