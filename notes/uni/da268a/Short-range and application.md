## BLE
- **Range**: ~10 meters
- Very low power consumption
- Data Rate: pup to 2Mbps (in BLE 5)
- **Advantages**:
	- Extremely energy efficient
	- Supported in smartphones
- **Limitations**: 
	- Not suitable for long range communications
	- Not suitable for high data throughput
- **Use** cases:
	- Wearables - Using BLE because device need to be powered on for extended periods of time. 
	- Proximity Detection -
- **Modulation:** GFSK(Gaussian Frequency Shift Keying)
- **Multiple Access / Channelization:** FHSS (Frequency Hopping Spread Spectrum)
- **Bandwidth** 2MHz channels within 2.4GHz ISM band (40 channels total) ISM = Industrial, Scientific and Medical Band.

## Zigbee
- **Range**: ~10-100 meters
- **Low power consumption**
- **Data Rate**: up to 250kbps
- In a Mesh network, each device can connect to multiple other devices
- **Advantages:**
	- Mesh support, reliable in dense deployments
- **Limitations:**
	- Not great for mobility; best in fixed deploymenys
	- Not suitable for long range coverage
- **Use case:** Smart home, health care, low data-rate control (like turning light off/on)
- **Modulation**: O-QPSK (Offset Quadrate Phase Shifting Keying) with DSSS (Direct Sequence Spread Spectrum)
- **Bandwidth**: 2MHz spacing, 16 channels in the 2.4GHz ISM band

## Wi-Fi
- **Range:** ~50-100 meters
- **Power usage:** Very high
- **Data rate**: Very High
Different standards(fyll i).
- **Advantages:** 
	- High bandwidth
	- Ubiquitous infrastructure
- **Disadvantages**
	- High power use
	- Limited range outdoors
	-
