## Terms
- **Data** - entities that convey meaning or information - analog/digital
- **Signals** - electric or electromagnetic representation of data - analog/digital
- **Transmission** - Communication of data by the propagation and processing of signals
## Analog signals
- A continuously varying electromagnetic wave that may be propagated over a variety of media depending on frequency
- Examples of media: 
	- Copper wire media(Twisted pair and coaxial)
	- Fiber optic
	- Atmosphere or space propagation
- Analog signals can propagate analog and digital data

## Digital signals
- A sequence of voltage pulses that may be transmitted over copper wire medium 
- Generally cheaper than analog signaling
- Less susceptible to noise interference
- Suffer more from attenuation
- Digital signals can propagate analog and digital data

Conversion from analog to digital, ([Nyquist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nyquist_frequency)). Highest frequency important

## Reasons for choosing data and signal combinations
- Analog data, analog signal
	- Analog data easily converted to analog signal
- Digital data, analog signal
	- Some transmission media (air) will only propagate analog signals
	- Examples include optical, satellite, mobile telephony
- Analog data, digital signal
	- Conversion permits use of modern digital transmission and switching equipment
- Digital data, digital signal
	- Equipment for encoding is less expensive than digital-to-analog equipment

## Analog transmission 
- Attenuation limits length of transmission link
- Cascaded amplifiers boost signals energy for longer distances but also noise that causes distortion
	- Analog data can sometimes tolerate distortion (e.g. voice)
	- Introduces errors in digital data

## Digital transmission
- Attenuation endangers integrity of data
- Digital signal
	- Repeaters achieve greater distance
	- Repeaters recover the signal and retransmit
- Analog signal carrying digital data
	- Retransmission device recovers the digital data from analog signal
	- Generates new, clean analog signal

## Description of electromagnetic signal
A electromagnetic signal can be described in to ways 
- As a function of time - time domain
- As a function of the frequency - frequency domain
Frequency domain is considered more useful.

## Time-Domain concepts
### Signal types
- A **periodic signal** is a pattern (which can be analog or digital) that repeats over time. Mathematically, this is defined as s(t + T) = s(t), where T is the period of the signal.
- An **aperiodic signal** is a pattern (analog or digital) that does not repeat over time.
- A **digital signal** is one where the signal intensity maintains a constant level for some period of time before changing to another constant level
### Sine Wave parameters
A general sine wave can be represented by the formula $s(t) = Asin(2\pi ft+\phi)$ 
The key parameters of this periodic analog signal are:
